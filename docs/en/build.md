Building and Dumping Assets
---------------------------

The is the simplest approach to using Assetic. It involves two steps:

 1. Create a PHP script in your web directory that uses the Assetic OOP API to
		create and output an asset.
 2. Reference that file from your template.

For example, you could create a file in your web directory at
`assets/javascripts.php` with the following code:

		use Assetic\Asset\AssetCollection;
		use Assetic\Asset\FileAsset;
		use Assetic\Filter\Yui\JsCompressorFilter as YuiCompressorFilter;

		$js = new AssetCollection(array(
				new FileAsset(__DIR__.'/jquery.js'),
				new FileAsset(__DIR__.'/application.js'),
		), array(
				new YuiCompressorFilter('/path/to/yuicompressor.jar'),
		));

		header('Content-Type: application/js');
		echo $js->dump();

In your HTML template you would include this generated Javascript using a
simple `<script>` tag:

		<script src="/assets/javascripts.php"></script>
